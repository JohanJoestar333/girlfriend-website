# Firebase setup

Firebase (Firestore) is what makes the site *shared*: both of you see the same
Bucket List, Movies, Music, Memories, Calendar, Day Cards, moods and Bouquet,
live. The Photo Booth also uses it briefly to connect your two cameras.

Everything here is on the free **Spark** plan. Without Firebase the site still
works, but each device only sees its own changes and the sync pill on shared
tabs shows **Not synced**.

## What lives in Firestore

| Collection | Used by |
|---|---|
| `bucketlist` | Bucket List items |
| `movies` | Movie Nights (watchlist, watched, ratings) |
| `musicsongs` | Music playlists |
| `memories` | Our Memories (caption, date, Cloudinary URL) |
| `albums` | Custom album names |
| `calendar` | Shared calendar events |
| `daycards` | Day Cards (expire after 24 h unless saved) |
| `moods` | Daily moods in the Today widget |
| `bouquets` | The current bouquet (one live document, wilts after a week) |
| `thommyPersonal` | Personal area (one document, `main`) |
| `photoboothCalls` | Photo Booth handshake, with sub-collections `callerCandidates` and `calleeCandidates` |

No camera video is ever sent to or stored in Firestore. Photos themselves live
on Cloudinary; Firestore only keeps their URLs. The "While you were away"
notifications need no collection — the browser tracks them itself.

## 1. Create the project

1. Open <https://console.firebase.google.com> and sign in with a Google account.
2. **Create a project** (or open an existing one). Analytics is not needed.

## 2. Enable Firestore

1. Left menu: **Build → Firestore Database → Create database**.
2. Choose a location close to you (it cannot be changed later).
3. Start in **production mode**; you will replace the rules in step 5.

## 3. Register the web app

1. **Project settings** (gear icon) → **General** → **Your apps** → **Web** (`</>`).
2. Give it a nickname. Skip Firebase Hosting.
3. Copy the `firebaseConfig` values shown: `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`,
   `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, `appId`.

## 4. Give the site your config

**For the deployed site (recommended):** add each value as a GitHub repository
secret under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `FIREBASE_API_KEY` | `apiKey` |
| `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | `authDomain` |
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | `projectId` |
| `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | `storageBucket` |
| `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | `messagingSenderId` |
| `FIREBASE_APP_ID` | `appId` |

The deploy workflow replaces the `__FIREBASE_*__` placeholders in
`js/data/config.js`. Push to `main` (or re-run the workflow).

**For local testing:** temporarily paste the values into `CONFIG.firebase` in
`js/data/config.js`. **Do not commit them.**

> **Is the API key secret?** No. A Firebase web API key only identifies your
> project; access is controlled by the security rules below. Keeping it in
> secrets is tidiness, not protection. See [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## 5. Security rules

**Firestore Database → Rules**, replace everything with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Shared features
    match /bucketlist/{docId}    { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /movies/{docId}        { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /musicsongs/{docId}    { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /memories/{docId}      { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /albums/{docId}        { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /calendar/{docId}      { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /daycards/{docId}      { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /moods/{docId}         { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /bouquets/{docId}      { allow read, write: if true; }
    match /thommyPersonal/{docId} { allow read, write: if true; }

    // Photo Booth handshake. Sub-collections need their own rules.
    match /photoboothCalls/{callId} {
      allow read, write: if true;

      match /callerCandidates/{candId} { allow read, write: if true; }
      match /calleeCandidates/{candId} { allow read, write: if true; }
    }

    // Everything else is blocked.
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

Click **Publish**.

**Why `if true`?** The site has no user accounts, so there is nothing to scope
access to. Only the collections listed above are open, and the data is
low-sensitivity (to-do items, captions, song titles). If you ever store
anything more private, add real authentication and tighten these rules.

> **Classic mistake: cameras turn on but never connect.** Firestore rules are
> *not* inherited by sub-collections. If `photoboothCalls` has no nested
> `callerCandidates` / `calleeCandidates` blocks, the offer/answer syncs (so it
> looks fine) but every connection candidate is silently rejected, and each of
> you only sees your own camera. A `permission-denied` message in the Photo
> Booth status almost always means this.

**Indexes:** the site only uses simple ordering on a single field, so you do
not need to create indexes. If Firestore ever offers a *Create index* link
after a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error, use that link; do not create indexes
speculatively.

## 6. Test it

1. Serve the site (`python3 -m http.server 8000`) or open the deployed URL.
   Do **not** open `index.html` via `file://`.
2. Open the site on two devices, or in two browsers.
3. **Bucket List:** add an item; it should appear on the other device within
   a second or two, and the sync pill should say it is live.
4. **Music, Calendar, Day Cards, Bouquet:** do the same.
5. **Photo Booth:** open the tab on both; the second person should see the
   first person's camera. (Different networks may also need
   [`turn-setup.md`](turn-setup.md).)

## 7. Troubleshooting

**The pill stays on "Not synced".** Check that all six values are present and
correct, that the secrets deployed (Actions run is green and you hard-refreshed
or reopened the installed app), and that `CONFIG.firebase` has no missing
comma, quote or brace.

**"Missing or insufficient permissions".** The rules are missing or were not
published, or a collection is not in the list above. Compare with step 5.

**One feature syncs but another does not.** That collection's `match` block is
missing from the rules.

**Data disappears after a refresh.** It was saved locally only; Firebase is not
connected. Fix the config and check the pill.

**Works on desktop but not on the phone.** The phone is probably showing an
old cached copy of the app. Close and reopen it (or clear the site's data). The
deploy stamps a new cache version on every push, so a normal reopen after the
new deploy finishes should update it.

## 8. Checking the data

In the Firebase Console: **Firestore Database → Data**. You should see the
collections from the table above, created as you use each feature. You can
edit or delete documents there if you ever need to clean something up.
